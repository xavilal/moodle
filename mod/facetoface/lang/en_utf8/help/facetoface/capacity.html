<h1>Capacity</h1>
<p><strong>Capacity</strong> is the number of seats available in a session.</p>

<p>When a face-to-face session reaches capacity the session details do not appear on the course page. The details will appear greyed out on the 'View all sessions' page and the learner cannot enrol on the session.</p>
